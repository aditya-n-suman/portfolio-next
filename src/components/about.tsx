				<p className="">
					Welcome to my portfolio! I&#39;m Aditya, a dedicated Frontend
					Developer with a strong emphasis on the React ecosystem. My journey in
					web development has equipped me with extensive experience in crafting
					applications using TypeScript, Next.js and TailwindCSS, where I focus
					on delivering outstanding user experiences through intuitive and
					interactive designs.
				</p>
				<p className="">
					In addition to my frontend expertise, I possess a robust skill set in
					backend technologies, including Node.js, Express.js, and NestJS. This
					dual proficiency allows me to build comprehensive, full-stack
					solutions that are not only functional but also scalable and
					maintainable.
				</p>
				<p className="">
					I have a deep appreciation for software design patterns, particularly
					the Modular Design Pattern, which I use to write clean, modular code
					that adapts well to changing requirements. I believe in continuous
					learning and enjoy working collaboratively to create innovative
					solutions. I invite you to explore my work and reach out â€” let&#39;s
					collaborate to turn your vision into reality!
